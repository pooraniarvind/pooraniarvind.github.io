### [Anchorless Pedestrian Detection](https://anushl9o5.github.io/pedestrian)
There is a large potential to improve real-time pedestrian detection to replace the human eye. This is inspired by FCOS: Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection to solve object detection in a per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue to semantic segmentation.[Read More...](https://pooraniarvind.github.io/pedestrian)
