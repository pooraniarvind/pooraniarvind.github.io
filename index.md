<font size="-1">Hey!<br>
Currently working as a Project Assistant at Video Analytics Lab, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), where I work on projects for developing algorithm and logic for pedestrian detection for autonomous vehicles. Apart from constant assimilation of technical knowledge in deep learning, computer vision and their relevant programming tools, this opportunity has helped to gain a lot of insight into the format of research itself. 

**Education:** B.TECH in Electronics and Communication Engineering, MIT Manipal (2015-2019) with a minor in embedded systems.

**Areas of Interest:** Computer Vision, AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, adaptive multi-robot systems and cognitive artificial intelligence. 

My goal is to pursue a career of research professional on technologies bringing cognitive artificial intelligence (CAI) to a level comparable to humans at a research-oriented, commercial, or academic organization.
